openttd-opensfx for Debian
--------------------------

This package is distributed under the Creative Commons sampling plus
license, since most of the samples used have been obtained under that
license. The sampling plus license contains restrictions that do not
follow the Debian Free Software Guidelines, so this package is shipped
in the non-free distribution.
